# 1: Develop a script to perform time series forecasting using techniques like ARIMA or LSTM networks

# Time Series Forecasting Analysis for Temperature using ARIMA Model

# Data:- 
Dataset used is the from Kaggle "C:\Users\hp\Desktop\New folder (2)\GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv"

# library Used:- 
Pandas
Numpy
seaborn 
Statsmodels python

# EDA:- 
Data Cleaning include removing unwanted columns,filling the missing values.

# Check Time Series Data Stationarity:- 
check plot and p-value is tested on 'Ticks', 'AverageTemperature'

# Modelling: 
Build model using ARIMA



#  2: Implement a basic anomaly detection algorithm from scratch

Anomaly detection algorithm using the Z-score method in Python. This method assumes that the data follows a Gaussian distribution and anomalies are the data points that are too far from the mean.  Data points with a Z-score greater than the threshold is 3 are considered as anomalies.




# 3: Write code to perform image classification using a pre-trained CNN architecture
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification in Python using the Keras library. Use the VGG16 model which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
